# Generative-Drone-Soundscape
An OS X audio-playback application triggered by keystrokes.


	Application Requirements:
		1gb RAM
		100mb free space on Hard Drive
		

# Operating the Application

Upon opening the sampler, select a keyboard input via the drop down menu. The selections change from computer to computer, so it is worth attempting to try different options if there is a problem with the application.

If there are no keyboard options, restart the machine. If the problem persists, toggle ‘Disable Background Functionality’ in settings. This prevents the application from working in the background, an issue that is unable to be resolved due to the software used to program the application.

To turn the sampler on, press the image. To turn it off, press the image a second time.

This sampler is designed to work in the background of your computer by minimizing the application. To achieve this, when the application is enabled, you must use the menu bar and select ‘Hide’.

To enable ‘Global Speed’, toggle the option in settings. This allows the number keys (0-9) to manipulate the sound. Toggling ‘Global Speed’ off returns the audio to its original settings.

To change the amount of keystrokes required to trigger a new sample, change the number next to ‘Amount of Keystrokes…’ text in settings and press enter. At its lowest number, 1, the application requires two keystrokes to trigger a sound.		

# Recording Audio

The typical recording method is using an audio interface: take either your left or right output and connect it to an input. In the GDS application, set your output to the audio interface. On your DAW of choice, do not use your interface as output, and make sure that on the interface the mix is at 0% for inputs in order to avoid feedback.
